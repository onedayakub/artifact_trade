[h2]Overview[/h2]

With this mod, you can search for artifacts, buy them from other characters, and sell them to other characters. The game doesn't have an artifact trading system, so this mod adds one. Since such a system would not be usable without advanced artifact filtering and sorting, it adds an "artifact finder" as well.

In version 1.9 CK3 enabled destroying of artifacts for gold, however it's fairly limited. No actual trading takes place, you can only sell but not buy, and only common and masterwork artifacts. Furthermore, you can [i]always[/i] sell, which undermines the realism.

This mod adds what is missing, and more. The system is balanced so that it does not offer significant advantages to the player. The AI will use it as well, initiating, accepting, or rejecting buy and sell interactions based on a comprehensive estimation of the artifact's usefulness and significance.

The base artifact prices in this mod correspond to the destroy prices in CK3 1.9. Actual trades are settled at slightly different prices that also depend on the AI greed of the accepting party and if the player is involved or not. The player can never sell or destroy an artifact at a price higher than the one they bought it.

When buying and selling artifacts, the AI acceptance is influenced by multiple factors. Besides the artifact rarity compared to that of other relevant artifacts, they include the artifact's durability, its uniqueness, is it equippable and beneficial to the character, is it unwanted or cursed, the character's claims or special relationship to the artifact, the artifact's price, and the character's wealth. In addition, the AI will never offer to pay more than their [i]short term budget[/i], and will only sell if the other party offers enough gold to pay the full price.

In case you don't like artifact trading for some reason, you can disable the trading part via a game rule.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

The current version is compatible with CK3 1.9. If you are still on 1.8, download version 0.3.0 from [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/attachments/search_and_trade_artifacts-0-3-0-zip.982525/]Paradox Forums[/url].

This mod is compatible with all other mods, including total conversion mods such as AGOT and EK2, except for those few mods that modify the [b]Inventory[/b] window. Put it after all other mods in the load order. In case of a conflict with another important mod, put it before that mod - you will lose the new [b]Inventory[/b] window buttons as a result but other features should work as expected.
